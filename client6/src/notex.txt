Why React ?
While everything we do in react can technically be done in plain HTML, CSS and Javascript, React allows :
. Better code reuse 
.Large-scale performance in production 
. Clean sepeeration of concerns via components
. Easier maintance and testing

Fodler Structure
src/
|-- components   #Reusable UI  components
|-- Pages        # Page-specific components
|-- Utils        # Constants, helper, and mock data

. src = source fodler. All app logic should reside here.
. you are free  to structure folder as you like, but the industry typically follows this convention.

.jsx vs .jsx

const  MyComponent = () => {
    return <h1>hello world</h1>;
};

export default MyComponent;

pros of .jsx :
.clarity : indicates the presence iof JSX 
. better editor support (highlighting,linting)
. Matches community convention

You can use .js, but:
.misleading for JSX-containing files
. May confuse older tooling 
. less expensive in file  lists


best practice :
use .jsx for components.
use .js for utilities config, and non-jsx 

you  can import  like this :
import Header from "./Components/Header.jsx
import Header from "./Components/Header


constants & static data 

Dont keep large static data or hardcoded strings inside components.

instead, extract to utils 
export const CDN_link = "http://cdnlink.com";
export const URL = "https://suhail.app";

//usage
import {CDN_link,URL} from "../utils/constants"

default Export 

//mockdata.js
export deafult data;

//usage 
import data from "..utils/mockdata";


.Avoid files longer than 100 lines
. if you exceed that, refactor into smaller components or files;
